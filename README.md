This Repo just exists so that I can get the codebase for my demo into [this Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Ekx-_CbADE0cD-QAAylFaiFBnCFi7dAU?usp=sharing).

The full version is available [here](https://github.tik.uni-stuttgart.de/FlorianLux/SpeechSynthesis). This is only accesible to members of the University of Stuttgart for now, but a fully public version is coming soonâ„¢, after students have played bug finding guinea pigs by using it for a semester.
